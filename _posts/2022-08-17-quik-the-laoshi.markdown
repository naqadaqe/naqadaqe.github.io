Want to learn a foreign language fast? <br/>But the process is long, tedious and not practical.

_So what is the most effective way to learn a language?_

##### Let's take a look at how to study smart in a foreign language!

<br/>

I believe everyone knows that **Chinese** <br/>is considered one of the _toughest languages_ in the world to master.

As a native speaker, I'll explain to show you how easy it is to learn and master it.

###### Once you have these basics knowledge, everything will be easy-peasy.

### Our word is in Character

![Â≠óz√¨](/assets/posts/make/quik-the-laoshi/zi.png){: .circle-img}

**Chinese**, is not based on alphabet but on a combination of strokes into a square-like character. This language is also _monosyllabic_, so each character is considered a word when we speak.

That's why I often explain the difference between English and Chinese in this way.
> ##### If English is like clay (Play-Doh), 
> ##### Chinese is like bricks (Lego).
> ###### Because English words will mutate, 
> ###### while Chinese are stacked and combined into new words with new meanings.

Now that you know, <br/>you can start learning your first word in numbers.

üòâ
Yes, start with numbers.

Thanks to numbering, <br/>they are the easiest and also commonly used in daily life conversations.

### Short Sentences

![Âè•j√π](/assets/posts/make/quik-the-laoshi/ju.png){: .circle-img}

After learning some words, <br/>you need to speak in **short sentences** to express what you want.

Think about what you would often express when you travel to a foreign place. Of course, you aren't going to introduce yourself to everyone you meet on the road.

##### Without any doubt, you use questions a lot! 

Whether you ask for a price, ask for directions, or greeting to someone.

**We need to learn to ask questions before learning to answer them.**

With the ability to ask questions, you don't have to fear speaking to any native speaker anymore.

### Pronunciation = Pinyin

![Èü≥yƒ´n](/assets/posts/make/quik-the-laoshi/yin.png){: .circle-img}

Most classes teach Chinese pronunciation at the beginning, <br/>but this boring training is also part of the reason students give up learning.

The best effective way to practice pronunciation is to **listen** and **talk** more with native speakers. Soon, you'll gradually start imitating their correct pronunciation.

###### Learning good pronunciation is necessary.

_Because not only to express our feelings, it also tell us the accurate meaning of the words._

üòõ But I, <br/>who used to speak _improper Chinese with a Malaysian accent_, can advice you:

##### Chinese pronunciation is not learned from books, but listened from the people. <br/>Your surrounding is very crucial for you to learn correctly

<br/><br/>

### Reading is always a good habit

![ËØªd√∫](/assets/posts/make/quik-the-laoshi/du.png){: .circle-img}

**Written characters** in Chinese that are difficult to remember and write are _the last to be learned_.
When you have good listening and speaking skills, daily life communication will not be a problem for you.

###### However, literacy is necessary. 

So that you can read the menu or read the signboard on the street.

_What's more interesting is that you can read a Chinese book yourself ~_

##### Regular reading will eventually teach you the skills of stating things and telling stories.
