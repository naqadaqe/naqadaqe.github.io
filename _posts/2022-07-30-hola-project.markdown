To get started, you just need to break your complex idea into small and manageable tasks.
所以我制作了一下几个实用APP(HOLA!Project)，可作为参考。
###### 绝对不是模拟，而是实际运用的应用程式。

Let's start one by one.

### O for OutWorkLess

Going back to when I was studying abroad, <br/> I realized how much I missed the taste of **"Roti Canai"**.

Every supper time, I would constantly think about the taste, that crispy feel, and that rich curry smell, but unfortunately I couldn't have it at that time.

as long as you want to eat, you can easily [download here](/assets/posts/write/recipe-in-translation/translate-roticanai.pdf){: target="_blank"} and read the _"Roti Canai"_ recipe I prepared for you, and just cook and try it.

But it is undeniable the best roti is in our Mamak stall ~ 😋

### L for Luang

The unforgettable taste from my childhood memory.

You definitely able to find it in any Chinatown nearby your place.

Chinese buns have more flavors than you can ever imagine. From sweet to salty, one of these flavors is sure to hit your taste buds. 
Some common flavors are:
- Red beans
- Peanut
- Lotus seed
- Kaya
- Cabbage
- Char Siew (pork)
- your [Baozi recipe](/assets/posts/write/recipe-in-translation/translate-baozi.pdf){: target="_blank"}
- and many more...

### A for Adate

In Malaysia, everyone loved it no matter what race or skin colour.

Curry is a home-cooked meal in almost every household. Each of them can create its own unique sweet smell.
It's _spicy but yummy_, even children who don't eat spicy food are fascinated by it. 

There is a funny scene you can see in Malaysia where everyone wipes their sweat with tissues and drink ice water to cool down, but still wolf down the curry.

You can see how much people loves [curry](/assets/posts/write/recipe-in-translation/translate-curry.pdf){: target="_blank"}.

###### Ah, great with roti canai too!

😂

<br/>

With so many races in Malaysia, <br/>the reason these dishes can spread down generation until now. <br/>There must be a multilingual recipe to back it up.

No matter what, <br/>we have to eat every day, and more or less we discuss about the food on the dining table.
So why not let the food satisfy our hunger, and also let it tell the story of our culture and traditions to the world.
