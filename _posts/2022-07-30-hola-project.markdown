Are you considering a digital transformation? <br/>Do you think that it is too expensive and time-consuming to make an app?

##### Don't overthink the process! 
###### What you want is simple, or maybe you already have what you want.

To get started on an app, <br/>you only need to break down your complex idea into small and manageable tasks.

Below I have made 4 sample apps. <br/>It's a good start, so I called it the **HOLA! Project**.

_These are not just prototypes but apps with actual functions._

üëá

**Let's go through these apps one by one.**

<br/><br/>

### H for HeroBuddy

There are many hiring apps and websites on the market. 

_How crazy is that!_ There are as many as the current unemployment rate...üôÉ

The difference is that this is a recruiting app for **hiring talented heroes**!

You can find your favourite hero here, and let them _perform at your party_ or _be your one-day-friend_. üôÜ
If you're a talented hero, you can also come to this place to advertise your various powers and abilities.

_**We are children's heroes and also their best buddies!**_

##### Welcome to search for your [HeroBuddy](){: target="_blank"} üîç

### O for OutWorkLess

Are you staying up late to chase your dreams? <br/>Planning to start a business, but you have no time for this?

##### Stop chasing your tail, come and ask [OWL](){: target="_blank"}! 

Let you _work smarter_ and still be able to _outwork everyone else_.

In this app, we have all the relevant advice for entrepreneurship and some easy-to-learn skills, so you don't have to rely on expensive courses that aren't useful to you.

##### Stop procrastinating and start doing!

Best of all, you can get help through online consultation, <br/>so you are no longer alone in starting a business.

### L for Luang

_We have serious pollutants outdoors, and you have lots of trash indoors._

You want to get rid of clutters or other household items that you no longer need but don't know how to unload those unnecessary things. As a result, you kept them around the house and let them take over your living space.

**If there is no leisure space ( ruang ), how can there be leisure time ( [Luang](){: target="_blank"} )?**

##### One man's trash is another man's treasure.

What you think is useless might be valuable to another. Therefore, we can help you to get rid of the trash and give it a new life.

After everything, <br/>
you can reduce waste, save our environment and regain your freedom and healthy lifestyle.

### A for Adate

**I hate long queues the most.** <br/>If you think the same as me, you must be agree that it's a complete waste of time.

So, you hope to _make an appointment in advance_. <br/>
However, for a company to make an appointment app, it not only consumes money, but it also takes time.

In fact, modern technology has advanced, <br/>_neither you nor your customers have to wait too long_.

##### Just need [Adate](){: target="_blank"} and a time, you can get what you request easily.

Now, you can think about how to make the most of the time you didn't waste waiting.

##### HOLA! 
##### Do you feel my warm greetings?

<br/>
The best time to start is now. <br/>
Don't worry about the opportunities and threats at this moment, you have a long way to perfect it in the future.

Why worry about **doing things right or doing the right things**?

How to start is more important than that.

Wish you good luck!
