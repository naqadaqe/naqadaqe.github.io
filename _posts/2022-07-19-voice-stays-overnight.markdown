The information age is quite fed up with noises. <br/>At the end of the day, what is the sound that still sticks in your head?

This is the mission to let your brand's voice get heard by your target audience, and let them always remember your brand purpose.

##### To get your audience's attention, you have to create resonance with them.

>##### Sound is ubiquitous, 
>###### coupled with the enormous traffic on the web.
>###### It's CRAZY how many sounds be heard in one day.
>#### But very few can really stand out.

Leaving _[how quiet influence us]()_ aside, <br/>let's start with the sounds we can be heard.

##### The voice you care about must have a certain degree of familiarity.

For example, a baby will recognize the mother's voice to a certain extent and will even imitate it.
That's also why couples are getting more alike over time.

People tend to like something more that feels familiar and relevant to their experiences.
That's why social bubbles form to make us feel better. **We need someone to speak OUR VOICE!**

🙌🙌🙌

###### Here are 3 key points that will allow you to find your brand's voice.

### Uniqueness

Speaking of the uniqueness of voice, you'll come up with all kinds of personas in a cartoon characters and their _memorable catchphrase_.

By taking advantage of this, you can make your voice more receptive to the audience and easy to impress.

### Be Persuasive

To convince someone to buy your products or services, not only do you need **strong facts**,
but you may also need to _cater to **customer favored**_.

Hmm.. this might be why I more often see women work in sales departments. <br/> ( 😯 stereotype)

The reason why the audience will prefer you, it must be your _voice sounds professional, confident and friendly_ 
(you can think yourself as an insurance agent, because **trust** is crucial to make business.)

But don't overdo it, what matters is that customers satisfied.

### Educational

This is a long-term strategy, <br/> we must do a lot of research and learn **good listening skill**.

You need to organize the information ahead, emphasize the key points and make good summary for easily digest.
_Understanding your audience's voice is an important catalyst for building trust_.

###### Always stay on the same page with your audience, and don't talk at cross purposes.

<br/>

Sometimes, <br/> 
you should even learn from your audience, speak in a way that makes it easier for them to absorb new knowledge.
That's why **computer voices still unable to replace human empathic voices**.
_(that's also why YouTube tutorial can easily replace college professors 😂)_

##### I believe every voice has its own uniqueness.

But it needs to be _properly use_ and _develop to its full potential_.

Your brand not only represents you and the mission you give it, but also the spirit of the entire team and its unique charm.
