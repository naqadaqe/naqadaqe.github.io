While it's true that WordPress is the most popular website builder, it's important to remember that you don't always have to follow the crowd. 

**Rather than settling for a slow and expensive platform, it's time to take control and BE YOUR OWN BOSS.**

>##### TL;DR 
>###### You want a fast and efficient website builder 
>#### Give Jekyll a try!

Before you start building your website, it's important to know what you want to achieve and where you want it to grow. Ask yourself some basic questions: 
- How much time do you want to spend maintaining your site? 
- How many features do you need? 
- Where do you want your site to be in the next 5 years?

**Are you planning to hit your target market quickly and have a site that's easy to maintain in the long run?**

##### If so, Jekyll might be the perfect choice for you.

###### Here's why. üïµÔ∏è

### Fast and Lightweight

Compared to many other website builders, Jekyll is incredibly fast and lightweight. Unlike other builders that can be slow to load, even on their paid versions. Jekyll's small and compact design means you won't have to wait for ages just to see your website. 

While you'll need to download Jekyll to your device, the files are small and efficiently designed to do exactly what you need, without any extra bloat or delays.

### Flexibility and Customization

Jekyll's flexibility means that it doesn't lock you down to a particular platform or approach. You have the freedom to explore and experiment, always seeking out the best tools and techniques for your needs. 

And if you find that Jekyll is no longer the best choice for you, there's no need to worry - switching to another platform is simple and painless. With Jekyll, you have the power to customize your website and adapt to your changing needs over time.

### Highly Scalable

Jekyll is a highly scalable website builder, giving you the freedom to add new features without the need to upgrade to a higher pricing plan. With Jekyll, you always have the option to find and install new plugins and customizations to your site, ensuring that you remain in control of your website at all times. 

This means that you no longer have to worry about comparing pricing plans or being restricted by feature limitations, and can instead build and maintain a site that _perfectly suits your needs_.

### Endless Possibilities

While you may think that Jekyll is primarily meant for publishing static sites, the truth is that it can do much more than that. 

For example, Jekyll allows you to treat your products as data files, which means that you can **easily create an amazing E-commerce store with great SEO optimization**. With a few simple tricks and tweaks, you can transform your Jekyll site into a fully-functional online store that can help you sell products and services, and grow your business over the long term.
