This book inspired me a lot in my everyday life.   
Hence I decide to build my own portfolio with my verbs, and live with it.

<br/><br/>



### About Me

<br/>

This is **Naqadaqe** speaking &#9996;   
the name came from Japanese pronunciation: ‰∏≠Â≤≥Ôºà„Å™„Åã„Å†„ÅëÔºâ.  
If this is hard to remember, just call my nickname **Quik**.

I grew up with an *eager spirit*, curiousity drives me to learn fast and makes my hand dirty to try out new things.
My time is spend on reading, writing, playing with ideas and bringing imagination into reality.
Sometimes, I help people to study better with my previous experience in teaching Chinese and Kungfu.

üí™ *By ignoring what I can't do, I live in the present, and do what I want to accomplish.*

<br/><br/>



### My Skill Set

<br/>

This makes me a *multi-talented* person and specialize in **creating sites** and **writing articles** for individuals and companies. 
If you want to have an *impactful and persuasive selling point* to your target customer, you should go for custom designs.

###### Not only your website's first impression is crucial, 
###### the whole ecosystem is the key to let customers to keep coming back.

As a linguaphile, I speak more than 3 languages.  
*(Chinese, English, Malay, Cantonese, Taiwanese)*   
My personality type is [**INFJ-T**](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality){: style="text-decoration: none;"}, 
and I really enjoy starting my day with a language learning podcast.


&#128519; Other than that,   
I enjoy spending my free time with my lovely wife, cooking, gardening and workout.

<br/><br/>

I believe your *passion* will truly make the world *different*.

<br/><br/>

**Love and Peace,**  
**Quik Naqadaqe.**
